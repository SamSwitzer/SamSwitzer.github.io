                                   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This week was the real beginnings of work on StARRRs. As a team (Serhii, Devon, Joshua, Ahmet, and Myself), we've come together to really start to visualize our project. We've decided, after a lot of back and forth, to create an action-adventure, rogue-like, dungeon crawler RPG with a fantasy-space theme. After I set up the Jira and Confluence for our team, I began working on the art for our GDD, inspired by The Binding of Isaac and pixel artists.  Using Aseprite and Tiled, I have been creating a tileset to help us visualize our ideas. During this week, we also decided on the game's name, StARRRs, which refers to the space theme and main character's pirate lore. A lot of the games mechanics were decided, mostly inspired by games like Undermine, Diablo II, and The Binding of Isaac. Joshua was able to find someone to assist us with the game's soundtrack, and we've been discussing different colour palettes for certain areas of the game. The story of the game was also figured out, showing our main character arriving on an abandoned space ship. After an accident, he is saved by pirates and indebted to them, forced to go on pillaging runs.

I've really enjoyed my time so far working with the art in the game, and I'm excited to create more, and for the future of StARRRs. Hopefully, in the coming week, we are able to solidify even more game mechanics, and a name for our development group. The base of the game is pretty solidified, so building it is up next.</p></br><hr>

                              <h2>What I've been working on…</h2>
                              	<li><b>Bot scripting for Old School Runescape, where I have already <a href="index.html#work">released</a> scripts for different experience-gaining or money-making methods.</b></li></br>

								<li><b>Flash art sheet, where I have multiple designs on one or many pages. This style of art is used by tattoo artists. With an ink machine of my own, I will be practicing the flash art sheets on fake skin and testing out the medium of tattooing.</b></li></br>

								<li><b>Top down, Legend of Zelda inspired game. In its early stages, I am developing this for Gameboy. I will be using GBStudio, a visual scripting development tool. Eventually, the game will be available on a gameboy flash cart or emulator.</b></li></br>

                              <h2>Currently playing…</h2>
                              <p>
                              	<li><b>Battlefield 2042. I’ve always been a fan of the Battlefield franchise, and when I learned I could subscribe to Origin’s Pro plan to play the new game, I jumped on. Unfortunately, the game lacks a lot of what made the previous games good. They tried to focus on a more minimalistic approach, but lost a lot of content in the process. The UI is accessible and clean, and the game is fun when it is running properly. It is really disappointing that, after as many games as DICE has put out, they have tried but failed at listening to what their player base will enjoy.</b></li></br>

								<li><b>World of Warcraft. I’ve played WoW for a large part of my life. I’ve also taken very large breaks from it. Everytime I come back to play, it seems like the game has changed almost everything with quality of life, content, and general updates. For an MMO, I find this to be a great thing. Constantly refreshing the way you can play a game keeps people interested, and keeping the player-loved aesthetics and gameplay is something WoW has done a great job with. I’m happy to be jumping back in. For the Horde!</b></li></br><hr>
